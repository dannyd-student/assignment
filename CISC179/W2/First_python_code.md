# First python code

#  A
```python
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```

#  B
```python
print("""All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.""")
```

#  C
Output will be : 127.0.0.1

#  D
flush=True is useful when needing to have instant output like a countodwn timer,
and then flush=False is good when you dont need instant output, like pritning a lot of data.

#  E
It forces python to write out the output immediately without buffer.
